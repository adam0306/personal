# Presentation Conundrum

- Markdown
    - Refreshing method but what if they're specifically looking for PowerPoint? Worth the risk?
- Docker Container
    - With the audience being primarily security people, I doubt many would be willing to run a random docker container on a machine.
- Video
    - Interesting method but sourcing content could be difficult and no real way to speak to content directly during playback.
- Standard Boiler Plate PowerPoint
    - The driest, cookie cutter method but C level like them.
